# University OOP Sheets Solutions in C++

Welcome to the repository dedicated to solving the university's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) sheets using C++. This repository contains solutions to various OOP exercises, designed to help students understand and apply OOP concepts in C++.

This repository provides solutions to a series of OOP exercises provided by the university. Each exercise is solved using C++, showcasing different OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.

## Folder Structure

- Each folder (e.g., `Sheet1`, `Sheet2`) corresponds to a specific sheet of exercises.
- Inside each folder, there are `.cpp` files, each containing the solution to an individual exercise.

## How to Use
 **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OOP-Sheets.git
   cd OOP-Sheets
```

- To compile an exercise (e.g., Exercise1.cpp), use a C++ compiler like g++:
```sh
g++ -o Q1 Q1.cpp
./Q1
```
